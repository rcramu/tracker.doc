**Hugo-theme-learn** is a theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and modern static website engine written in Go. Where Hugo is often used for blogs, this theme is fully designed for **technical documentation**.

This theme is a partial porting of the [Learn theme](http://learn.getgrav.org/) of [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), a modern flat-file CMS written in PHP.

This current documentation has been statically generated with Hugo with a simple command : `hugo -t hugo-theme-learn`
